# Resilience remediation — staged acceptance

Baseline: `2f34ad805bc31c81da2bafd045f9da89c8cc4dc3`; working branch
`resilience-stages-20260905`. No stage may silently inherit unaccepted firmware
changes from another stage. Each stage gets a commit, saved binaries, tests,
and an explicit acceptance decision before the next live deployment.

## Categories and order

Complexity/risk are implementation/change risk, not severity of the existing bug.
High-risk rows are separate stages, never a single combined deployment.

| Stage | Category / audited issues | Complexity / risk | Acceptance gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Source and firmware recovery points | Low / low | Source bundle and image hashes preserved |
| 1 | OTA: false-positive update confirmation, B startup/retry, handler registration and validation gating | Medium / high (recovery path) | Host failure-path tests; both firmware builds; B then A one at a time; exact image and boot state verified; owner phone smoke test |
| 2 | Input/memory safety: JSON root/type/finite/integer validation and optional id; oversized app writes/id bounds; short settings and tunnel records; retained/fragmented command rejection | Medium / low–medium, bounded bundle | Sanitizer boundary/malformed-input tests, both builds, unchanged valid app reads/writes; no live battery-setting tests without safety gate |
| 3 | Frame reassembly: unconsumed bytes after completed frame | Medium / medium, isolated | Consecutive records at every chunk boundary, bad checksum/resync tests, live frame rates |
| 4 | Runtime state: non-atomic read/modify/write | High / high, isolated | Concurrent field-update tests, app-demand/idle transitions and soak |
| 5 | BLE discovery and boot verification: failed discovery cleanup, false frame evidence, app-safe release | High / high, isolated | Failure injection on bench; successful discovery, silent peripheral, app attach during verify; quiet-idle preserved |
| 6 | Command lifecycle: link-up flush drops valid work, stale work across sessions, false→false resync polling, BLE-off cancellation | High / high, isolated | Queue/order/session-generation tests; reconnect/drop tests; no stale or unintended writes |
| 7 | TCP transport: blocking connect/read/write, short sends, dead/grace deadlines | High / high, isolated | Host socket fault injection (slow peer, partial header/body, blackhole/backpressure), deadline and reconnect soak |
| 8 | MQTT isolation: synchronous publication stalls critical tasks; broker outage restarts healthy WiFi | High / high, isolated | Bounded memory/queue and broker-outage tests; BLE/tunnel remain responsive |
| 9 | Cache correctness: replacement identity persistence, stale settings, missing read-cache priming | Medium / medium, isolated | Replacement/reboot/expiry tests; owner app warm-start; no NVS schema migration |
| 10 | Notification delivery: queue loss and ignored BLE errors; replay mid-record | High / high, isolated | Saturation tests and byte-level replay/live ordering; phone sessions under load |
| 11 | Write confirmation: overwritten/early readback, dispatch/drop correlation, missing WRITE_RESULT | High / high, isolated | Simulated dispatch/readback failures first; live benign setting round trip only with explicit safety clearance |
| 12 | Maintenance bundle: disabled measurement recovery path; stale docs/test commands/post-app opcode | Medium / medium | Host tests and startup/recovery checks; reconcile docs with accepted behaviour |

## Rollback and live test rules

- Baseline files are outside the worktree at
  `/Users/dw/Downloads/jk-ble-tunnel-rollback/20260905-baseline/`.
  They include source.bundle, both existing app binaries/sdkconfigs and the old
  updater. These are preserved build outputs, **not device flash readbacks**;
  their equivalence to the previously running images is not proven.
- Baseline app SHA256: A
  `cb37042b60a63e40b1d64bfc75ad57862eb60b49ee1c2e2775c8415097d7cb86`, B
  `4ef8a8f96f481b949f5b4619594074f20adfe570e18f63d6d57d2e618701d5bd`.
- Preserve accepted stage images before any subsequent build. Use explicit
  `--bin /absolute/path/to/saved/node_X.bin` for backout, never a mutable build
  path. Verify hashes and target (A: ESP32-S3 `.239`; B: ESP32-C3 `.234`).
- Source backout uses `git revert <stage-commit>` after checking the worktree;
  no hard reset, destructive checkout, force push, flash erase or NVS erase.
- No partition-table, bootloader, credential or persistent-data format changes.
  A/B wire compatibility must remain valid during rolling updates/backout.
- Flash only one node at a time. Keep the other on its accepted image until
  the first is checked. An accepted image may overwrite the automatic rollback
  slot on the next update: saved host binaries are the durable recovery path.
- If OTA is unavailable, stop and use owner-assisted USB application-only
  recovery with the saved matching binary and existing partition layout.
  Do not claim automatic rollback can repair every hang; it needs a reset.
- An HTTP listener proves reachability, not firmware identity or BLE health.
  Require exact ELF identity and valid boot state where the endpoint exists;
  a legacy image needs independent boot/app checks and an explicit legacy mode.
- Preserve quiet-idle, passive scanning and the owner's nightly reboot policy.
  Do not use bank 0's known hardware failure as a firmware acceptance test.
- Owner confirmed availability for phone testing/USB recovery on 2026-09-05.
  Calibration/cell-count/bounce/power-cycle tests remain prohibited until owner
  confirms iBMS charge control is disabled. Do not fault-inject the live broker
  or live battery commands as a substitute for a bench test.

## Status

- Stage 0: complete; baseline saved and branch created.
- Stage 1: local implementation committed as `8329df0`; 16 updater tests and
  35 sanitizer-enabled protocol checks passed, both firmware targets built.
  Node B deployed successfully (HTTP 200, ota_1); exact expected ELF
  `79888f98507eb6dda5e7f20cefcef86cef087c5d67b381ee22af2a2224e0af8c`
  and OTA VALID verified. **Awaiting owner read-only phone/app check. Node A
  has NOT been deployed.** No later stage is accepted or deployed.
- Stage 1 artifacts and backout commands:
  `/Users/dw/Downloads/jk-ble-tunnel-rollback/20260905-stage1-ota/MANIFEST.md`.
- Stages 2–12: pending; acceptance gates deliberately prevent batch deployment.
